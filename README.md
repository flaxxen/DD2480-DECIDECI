# Essence: Way of Working
We assess that our current state is in the early stages of **in use**. More specifically at the checkpoint “The practices and tools are being used to do real work”. This is because we use the practices and tools, that we agreed upon, to solve the assignment. The previous two states are in regard to establishing principles, tools, and practices. Some of the checkpoints within these states are rather poorly suited for this assignment, for example, those in regard to stakeholders. Aside from that the team committed and agreed to the principles and constraints for the way of working, which we assess fulfilled the first state. For the second state, **Foundation Established**, the practices and tools were also selected and agreed upon (In the form of git, Java, Maven, Junit, discord). One checkpoint within this state that is probably not fulfilled is “All non-negotiable practices and tools have been identified”. This is not a task that was done and you could therefore argue that we didn’t get past this state. We do however feel that this is another checkpoint that is rather poorly suited for this assignment and assess that we reach the third state. The obstacles that are needed in order to reach the next state is to start to inspect and adapt our tools and practices, as this is something that we haven’t done. We would have to discuss and perform an evaluation to find what suits us and our work the best.
