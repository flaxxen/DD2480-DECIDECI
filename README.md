# DD2480-DECIDE

This is a module that is used in a anti-ballistic missile system used to decide whether to launch, or not launch a missile given certain inputs from its intruments.

Inputs are supplied via the Input class's static variables and then the decide method in the Decide class can be run to print a yes/no to the standard output representing launch/no launch.

## Dependencies
* JDK 17
* Apache Maven 3.8.7

## How to use
If you want to integrate package into your missile system you need to download and compile the code yourself. From there you can import the classes into your program and link when building your program. Make sure to set all relevant variables in the Input class before calling the decide method!

## How to run tests
To run all tests, browse to the project folder and run
```mvn test```
in the command line.
